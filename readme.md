# Moviexx App

Movie info application built with vanilla JavaScript that uses **version 3** of the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3)


This includes the most popular movies and top rated TV shows with detail pages, a search box for movies and a slider for movies that are currently playing in cinema. The slider uses the [Swiper](https://swiperjs.com) library.

In this project I have used what I learned from the courses "Modern JavaScript From The Beginning 2.0 - 2023 Revamp" , "50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript" on udemy.
